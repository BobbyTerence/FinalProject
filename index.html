        <p> Hello! My name is Will Flowers! This website is designed to show you
          a little bit about myself. What I do, what I would like to do, and what
          I have done in the past. </p>

        <div class = "box">

              <h3> General Information </h3>
              <p> My name is Will Flowers, and I am 22 years old. My height is 6'3".
                I have a dog named Bailey, and she's the sweetest, 75lbs lab mix you
                will ever meet. </p>

              <h3> Background </h3>
              <p> I went to high school at Helias Catholic, I attended Truman State
                University for 3 and a half years, or 7 semesters. I completed 3
                semesters as a Music Education major with a Math minor. I then changed
                majors to Computer Science and completed 4 semesters of that.
                It took me that long to know that a liberal arts college, especially
                one as intense as Truman, was not the right choice for me. Now I'm
                attending State Tech for their Computer Application Development Program </p>

              <h3> General Family </h3>
              <p> Both of my parents are still together. My Father's name is
                James 'Clinton' Flowers, he goes by Clinton. My Mother's name is
                Mary Flowers. I have two siblings who are both older than I am.
                My sister's name is Emma Flowers, and she is 10 years older than
                I am. My brother's name is Benjamin Flowers, and he is 7 years older
                than I am. I will be giving more detailed information about them in
                the Friends and Family page. </p>
