            <h2> Photography </h2>
              <p> I've been interested in photography since the beginning of Covid.
              I've only done film photography at this point, and I haven't been
              keeping up with it as much as I want to, but it is still a really
              enjoyable activity when I find the time to do it. </p>
              <p> A few of the things I've learned along the way is about exposure,
                film sensitivity, and focal length-stop, or f-stop. </p>
              <p> You can find a collection of some of the photos I've taken

              <h2> Music </h2>
              <p> I've been an avid listener and player of music for the last 10
                years or so. I'm primarily a percussionist, focusing mainly on four
                mallet marimba. </p>
              <p> When I first started learning how to play, I ended up taking a couple
                of solos to Missouri District Solo and Ensemble, and I got a 2 my
                junior year, and a 1 my senior year. </p>
              <p> rergrettably, I don't have my own recordings of these solos, but I have
                good quality recordings by other people </p>

              <h2> Fitness </h2>
              <p> I've been consistently working out and been invested in fitness
                for about 4 years off and on at this point. </p>
              <p> I started working out for health benefits specifically, but
                eventually, I got hooked on it, and now I do it primarily for myself </p>
              <p> Since I've started working out, my mental health has improved
                significantly, and I've done my best to get as many people as I can
                to join me crazed hobby </p>

              <h2> Magic the Gathering </h2>
              <p> Magic the Gathering is a trading card game with multiple different
                playable formats, but the only format I play is Commander. </p>
              <p> Commander is a 100 card singleton format. Singleton means that
                there can only be one copy of each unique card except for basic
                lands. </p>
              <p> Commander also has a specific card called a Commander, which is
                a legendary creature in its own zone, which increases in cost each
                time it is cast from its zone. </p>
