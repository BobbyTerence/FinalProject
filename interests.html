         <h2> Photography </h2>
          <p> I've been interested in photography since the beginning of Covid.
           I've only done film photography at this point, and I haven't been
           keeping up with it as much as I want to, but it is still a really
           enjoyable activity when I find the time to do it. </p>
          <p> A few of the things I've learned along the way is about exposure,
            film sensitivity, and focal length-stop, or f-stop. </p>
          <p> You can find a collection of some of the photos I've taken
            <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vj-17UpjtNCxN6Gt0td-8hrP2vZFN7BC?usp=sharing"

        <div id = "music">
          <h2> Music </h2>
          <p> I've been an avid listener and player of music for the last 10
            years or so. I'm primarily a percussionist, focusing mainly on four
            mallet marimba. </p>
          <p> When I first started learning how to play, I ended up taking a couple
            of solos to Missouri District Solo and Ensemble, and I got a 2 my
            junior year, and a 1 my senior year. </p>
          <p> My junior year solo can be found <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4pN2fta64k"
            target = "_blank"> here</a>. </p>
          <p> My senior year solo can be found <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dgg6Esha94"

        <div id = "fitness">
          <h2> Fitness </h2>
          <p> I've been consistently working out and been invested in fitness
            for about 4 years off and on at this point. </p>
          <p> I started working out for health benefits specifically, but
            eventually, I got hooked on it, and now I do it primarily for myself </p>
          <p> Since I've started working out, my mental health has improved
            significantly, and I've done my best to get as many people as I can
            to join me crazed hobby </p>

        <div id = "mtg">
          <h2> Magic the Gathering </h2>
          <p> Magic the Gathering is a trading card game with multiple different
            playable formats, but the only format I play is Commander. </p>
          <p> Commander is a 100 card singleton format. Singleton means that
            there can only be one copy of each unique card except for basic
            lands. </p>
          <p> Commander also has a specific card called a Commander, which is
            a legendary creature in its own zone, which increases in cost each
            time it is cast from its zone. </p>
          <p> You can find my decklists <a href = "https://archidekt.com/search/decks?owner=Mistaflowas&ownerexact=true&"
